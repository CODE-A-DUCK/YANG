**The most efficient nitro generator and checker you'll ever find.**  
Made with ‚ù§ by **Tenclea**.

If you liked this project, please consider starring it <3

## Main features

* Proxy scrapper and checker
* Code generator and checker 
* Full webhook support
* Auto nitro-redeem

With a list of fresh proxies, I often reach ~30 checks/second.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [A Discord token](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token)

## Setup

* Clone or download this repository to your computer.
* Copy your token in the `redeemToken` field in the `config.json` file (use notepad to open it), and edit the other config variables as you like.
* Paste fresh http(s) proxies into `proxies.txt`.
* Open up a command prompt in it and type `npm install` to install the requirements.
* Start the generator by typing `node app.js` .
* If any error pops out, make sure to fix it before using the generator.

### Config file

These are the "global/config variables" :

* `debugMode` > Prints additional information to the console, like proxies connection errors. (true/false)
* `redeemToken` > The token the nitro codes will be applied to. (String)
* `saveWorkingProxies` > Whether to write or not the working proxies to `working_proxies.txt` (recommended). (true/false)
* `scrapeProxies` > Whether to automatically or not download fresh proxies from online sources. (true/false)
